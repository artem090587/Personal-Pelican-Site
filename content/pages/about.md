##Bryan Travis Smith, Ph.D


Hidy-Ho!  Welcome to my corner of the interwebs.   This site exists to show off projects I am working on, and to post things I am interesting in.  Topics will likely include particle phsyics, robotics, artifical intelligence, machine learning, and martial arts.  

I hold a Ph.D in High Energy Particle Physics from UC Irvine, am half way through a online M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech, and have just finished a Nanodegree from Udacity.com for Data Analysis.   I will be spending the summer of 2015 in San Francisco at the [Zipfian Academy](http://www.zipfianacademy.com/) completing a data science boootcamp. 

For the last 7 years I have been teaching physics and robotics at [The Buckley School](http://www.buckley.org/), [New Roads](http://www.newroads.org/), and [The Bishop's School](http://www.bishops.com), have mentored multiple FIRST and VEX highschool robotics team, and have completed programming projects in my spare time.   

On top of being analytically minded, I am also a life long Martial Artist.  I currently hold the rank of Yondan (4th Degree Black Belt) in Okinawan Karate and am currently one of three Assitant Chief Instructors for the [Okinawan Goju Ryu Kenkyu Kai](http://ogrkk.com/)


In a past life I did some origianl research.  Feel free to check it out.
